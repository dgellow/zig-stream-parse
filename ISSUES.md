# ZigParse: Issues and Progress Tracking

This document tracks known issues, completed fixes, and planned improvements for the ZigParse project.

## Resolved Issues

### Benchmark System (Fixed 2025-05-07)

- ✅ Fixed segmentation faults in benchmark tokenizer
- ✅ Added fallback benchmark mode for stability
- ✅ Implemented error state transitions for all parser states
- ✅ Added error handling in benchmark runner
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation in BENCHMARK.md

### Tokenizer System (Fixed 2025-05-07)

- ✅ Fixed ByteStream bounds checking to prevent segmentation faults
- ✅ Improved memory management in tokenizer with proper allocation/deallocation
- ✅ Added proper error recovery in token matchers
- ✅ Fixed memory leaks in lexeme handling
- ✅ Enhanced defensive coding in stream operations

## Known Issues

### Parser Implementation

- ✅ Fixed: Tokenizer crash on certain input patterns
- ✅ Fixed: Improved error handling in tokenization process
- ✅ Fixed: Enhanced memory management in tokenization process
- ⚠️ ByteStream only supports memory sources, not file or reader sources as documented
- ⚠️ ByteStream lacks the buffer management implementation described in documentation
- ⚠️ Incremental parsing (`process()` and `finish()` methods) not implemented
- ⚠️ SIMD-accelerated token matching described in docs not implemented
- ⚠️ Memory pool for tokens described in docs not implemented
- ⚠️ Compile-time token tables mentioned in docs not implemented

### Cross-Language Support

- ✅ Fixed: C API for cross-language integration implemented (2025-05-07)
- ⚠️ Cross-language bindings mentioned in docs not provided

### Documentation

- ⚠️ Discrepancy between documented features and actual implementations
- ⚠️ Missing examples for some common use cases
- ⚠️ Performance characteristics not fully documented

### Testing & Benchmarking

- ⚠️ Test coverage is limited
- ⚠️ Edge cases not thoroughly tested
- ⚠️ Missing fuzzing tests for parser robustness
- ✅ Fixed: Benchmark system now uses full parser implementation
- ⚠️ Memory usage metrics in benchmarks return dummy values

## Technical Debt

Technical debt represents design decisions, implementation shortcuts, or architecture choices that may need to be revisited in the future to ensure long-term maintainability and performance.

### Architecture & Design

- ⚠️ ParserHandle uses global ID counter (`generateUniqueId()`) that isn't thread-safe
- ⚠️ Hard-coded token and state IDs make it difficult to compose parsers
- ⚠️ No resource limits for token buffer sizes, could lead to memory issues
- ⚠️ Event handling is synchronous only, limiting throughput for complex parsers

### Implementation Patterns

- ⚠️ Linear search for transitions in state machine (`findTransition`) is inefficient for states with many transitions
- ⚠️ String duplication in ParserContext could be avoided with better memory management
- ⚠️ Error tokens use maximum u32 value (`std.math.maxInt(u32)`), making it difficult to handle real tokens with high IDs
- ⚠️ Error states in benchmark.zig bypass normal actions, potentially hiding issues

### Future Compatibility

- ⚠️ Current Tokenizer design may not easily support incremental tokenization
- ⚠️ Handle-based design not consistently used throughout the codebase
- ⚠️ Event types are enum-based, making extension difficult without modifying core code
- ⚠️ Lack of versioning strategy for future C API compatibility

## Planned Improvements

### Short Term

- Implement proper error recovery in tokenizer
- Fix ByteStream to support all documented source types (file, reader)
- Implement buffer management in ByteStream as described in docs
- Enhance debugging output for parser components
- Add more comprehensive test cases
- Fix memory handling in ByteStream for large inputs

### Medium Term

- Implement incremental parsing (`process()` and `finish()` methods)
- Complete the Grammar builder API implementation
- Add memory pool for tokens
- Implement compile-time token tables
- Add support for more common parsing patterns
- Improve error reporting and diagnostics
- Optimize performance for large files
- Fix benchmark system to properly test full parser

### Long Term

- Implement the C API for cross-language compatibility
- Add SIMD-accelerated parsing for performance-critical operations
- Create bindings for popular languages
- Develop a standard library of common format parsers (JSON, CSV, etc.)
- Add memory usage metrics to benchmarks
